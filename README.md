# Quintin Vizza â€“ Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student who loves building things with code â€” whether itâ€™s websites, AI projects, or tools that make life a little easier. This site is my space to share the work Iâ€™ve done, the skills Iâ€™ve picked up, and the projects Iâ€™m most proud of.  

Itâ€™s built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and deployed with Vercel, but more importantly, itâ€™s a place where I can show my journey as a developer and engineer.  

### What youâ€™ll find here
- A little about me and what Iâ€™m working on
