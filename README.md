Welcome to my portfolio! 👋  

I’m a Computer Engineering student who loves building things with code — whether it’s websites, AI projects, or tools that make life a little easier. This site is my space to share the work I’ve done, the skills I’ve picked up, and the projects I’m most proud of.  

It’s built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and deployed with Vercel, but more importantly, it’s a place where I can show my journey as a developer and engineer.  

### What you’ll find here
- A little about me and what I’m working on  
- Some of the projects I’ve built (with links to the code)  
- Ways to get in touch with me (GitHub, LinkedIn, email)
